These bots were originally leaked. To ensure safety and transparency, I'm releasing a revised version directly on my GitHub. Feel free to examine the source code for your understanding.

Installation:

1. Install the Tampermonkey browser extension (https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Add the "script.user.js" file to Tampermonkey as a new userscript.
3. Edit the "config.json" file (within the "files" folder) to customize bot behavior.
4. Add proxies you intend to use in "proxies.txt" (in the "files" folder).

Running the Bots

1. Double-click the "run.bat" file. This will install required dependencies if it's the first run.
